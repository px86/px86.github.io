Hi, I am Pushkar. I currently live in Delhi NCR, India, and work as an analyst for one of the big fours. In my free time, I like to code and learn new technologies. I am a huge proponent of free and open source software, that respect the user's privacy. I occasionally read philosophical texts, mostly related to stoicism.
