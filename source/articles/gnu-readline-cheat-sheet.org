Shells like =bash= use =GNU Readline= for providing line editing capability. It's important to know the basic keybindings to be effective in the command shell.

* Notation

- =C-y= means Control + y
- =M-x= means Meta + x, Meta is usually bound to the Alt key.

* Must know keybindings

* Other useful keybindings

** =M-C-y= yank-nth-arg

This command yanks the first argument of the previous command(s). You can pass an argument, let's say 3, with the key-sequence =M-3 M-C-y=, to extract the 3rd argument of the previous command.

** =C-x C-e= edit-and-execute-command

Edit current command in =EDITOR= and execute it.

** =C-x C-u= undo

Undo you line edits.

** =M-r= revert-line

Discard any edits made and restore the history line.
